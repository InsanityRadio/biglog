#Â BigLog

BigLog is a Record of Transmission system that, basically, dumps an Icecast stream to a file. These files can be incremented hourly.

In fact, it can support recording a large number of Icecast streams into files. _How_ many is a good question we don't have an answer to. 

## Usage

```javascript
	import Rotter from './lib/rotter';
	import path from 'path';

	const options = {
		directory: path.resolve('./logs') + '/%S-%D',
		format: '%S-%X.mp3'
	}

	new Rotter('http://your.streaming.url/monitor.mp3', 'station-name', options);
```
